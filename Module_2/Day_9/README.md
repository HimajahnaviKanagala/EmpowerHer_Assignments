AI Tools Used :

This project was created using a combination of ChatGPT and Bolt.new:

Step 1 — Prompt Creation (ChatGPT)

I used ChatGPT to generate a detailed prompt describing the full project requirements, including:

Required sections (Header, Hero, Skills, Footer)

Responsiveness behavior for desktop/tablet/mobile

Style expectations

Color theme ideas

Structure of HTML and CSS files

ChatGPT helped refine and finalize the prompt until it was clear and ready for use in an AI code generator.

Step 2 — Template Generation (Bolt.new)

The final prompt was then copied into Bolt.new, which generated:

The initial index.html file

The basic style.css file

The basic layout and component structure

Bolt.new provided a clean starting point for the project.

Manual Code Edits :

These parts of the project were manually customized by me:

Updated my name, email, and personal details in the header/footer

Adjusted the social media links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email)

Modified icon sizes inside .social-link i { font-size: 2rem; }

Added custom skill card text (HTML, CSS, JS, React, Node, Design)

Tweaked layout spacing and image/icon sizes

Added or modified mobile responsiveness based on my preference

Edited color themes and gradient choices

Added personal content in About, Skills, and Contact sections
